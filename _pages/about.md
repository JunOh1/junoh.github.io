My name is Jun Oh and I am an assistant professor at Purdue University. I hold a Ph.D in Accounting from Cornell University and a CPA license in Korea (KICPA).

My research focuses on the use of firms’ public disclosures, including disclosures in financial statements and voluntary communications, by various stakeholders. 
Specifically, I am interested in how firms strategically disclose information (e.g., product markets, R&D, competition) and the consequences such disclosures have on stakeholders such as competitors and regulators. 
My research is largely motivated by industrial organization topics, such as contracting, product markets, and technology competition. 
I also am interested in how emerging technologies (e.g., algorithmic trading and automation investments) influence firms' information environment. 

My dissertation examines the intersection between industrial organization and antitrust regulation by studying how antitrust risk affects firms’ disclosure of mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
