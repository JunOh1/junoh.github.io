### "Antitrust Risk and Voluntary M&A Disclosure" <em>(Dissertation)</em>
This study examines whether antitrust risk affects firms’ disclosure of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Due to regulatory exemptions, deals that fall below a size threshold escape formal antitrust scrutiny at the time of the merger. These “non-reported” deals can have important implications for the firm’s pricing power of its products in segmented and localized markets. I hypothesize that firms face a trade-off between the benefits of disclosing these deals to capital markets (i.e., capitalize the product market benefits into stock prices in a timely manner) and the potential antitrust scrutiny the voluntary disclosure can invite, which increases the probability of agencies challenging the merger. Exploiting two quasi-exogenous variations in antitrust enforcement that affect the level of antitrust risk, I find evidence of acquirers strategically managing their disclosure of horizontal and intrastate deals according to the level of antitrust risk. My findings shed light on a new determinant of voluntary disclosure: the risk of costly antitrust enforcement.

### "Technology Coopetition and Voluntary Disclosures of Innovation" <em>with P. Eric Yeung</em>
We examine firms’ voluntary disclosures of innovation under technology coopetition, focusing on technology standard setting organizations (SSOs). Technology coopetition is characterized by i) cooperation to determine technology standards, which requires information sharing to reach consensus, and ii) competition for standard implementation to obtain standard-essential patents, which creates incentives for firms to deviate from the expected level of information sharing. We document a decrease in 10-K narrative R&D disclosures, more generic 10-K narrative R&D disclosures, and longer delay of patent disclosures to the USPTO after a firm joins an SSO. Among alternative explanations, our evidence is more supportive of the hypothesis that firms strategically withhold innovation information.

### "Media Conglomeration, Local News, and Capital Market Consequences" <em>with Travis Dyer and Mark H. Lang</em>
We examine the effect of news media consolidation on local business news coverage and its consequences for firms, local investors, and capital markets. Using television transcripts, we find a substantial drop in coverage of local firms following the consolidation of local television stations associated with Sinclair acquisitions. Local information search, portfolio local bias, overall retail trading, and local stock return synchronicity all decrease for firms in treated geographic areas. Results are most pronounced for small firms and for stations with higher ex-ante viewership and greater reductions in local coverage. We find similar capital market effects following newspaper and other television consolidations. Our results provide insight into the consequences of media consolidation for local business coverage, firms, investors, and capital markets.

### "Contract Contingencies, Uncertainty, and Firm Performance" <em>with Kai Wai Hui, Guoman She, and P. Eric Yeung</em>
This study examines contingencies written in firms’ material product market contracts, focusing on i) exogenous uncertainty as an ex-ante determinant, and ii) operating efficiency and betas as ex-post consequences. We extract material contracts from firms’ public regulatory filings and document a linear, positive relation between contract contingencies and measures of uncertainty. We utilize two major economic shocks (the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID pandemic) to i) identify causality, and ii) detect ex-post consequences of contract contingencies: Contingent contracts allow firms to achieve relatively higher operating efficiency and lower betas when low-likelihood economic outcomes realize.

### "Does Algorithmic Trading Affect Forced CEO Turnover? A Learning Hypothesis" <em>with Jaewoo Kim, Hojun Seo, and Luo Zuo </em>
We examine the effect of algorithmic trading (AT) on the extent to which directors rely on stock returns in CEO turnover decisions. We find that the sensitivity of forced CEO turnover to stock returns decreases with AT. We alleviate potential endogeneity concerns by using the 2016 Tick Size Pilot Program as an exogenous shock to AT. We document that the negative effect of AT is more pronounced for growth firms, firms with greater exposure to macroeconomic factors, and firms with a geographically dispersed investor base, where the information that AT crowds out is more likely to be new to directors. We also find that the effect is stronger when directors’ expertise likely allows them to extract decision-relevant information from stock returns and when the directors’ own information set is poor. Overall, our findings suggest that stock returns contain information that directors do not otherwise have regarding CEO-firm match and that directors incorporate this information into their CEO turnover decisions.
