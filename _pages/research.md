### "Antitrust Risk and Voluntary M&A Disclosure" <em>(Dissertation)</em>
This study examines whether firms alter the disclosure of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to reduce the likelihood of being targeted by antitrust authorities. Due to exemptions under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, deals that fall below the pre-merger notification threshold can escape formal antitrust scrutiny at the time of merger. However, when firms voluntarily disclose the deal, they can invite antitrust scrutiny, increasing the probability of a merger challenge. Evidence from stealth deals, intrastate deals, and horizontal deals suggest that such risk incentivizes acquirers to lower disclosure, to provide fewer positive disclosures, and less information regarding product markets and industry competition. Collectively, my findings suggest that firms internalize the political costs associated with antitrust risk when disclosing M&A and highlight a potential conflict between securities and antitrust regulation.

### "Technology Coopetition and 10-K Voluntary R&D Disclosure" <em>with P. Eric Yeung</em>
We examine firms’ voluntary R&D disclosure under technology coopetition, focusing on the technology standard setting organizations (SSOs). Technology coopetition is characterized by i) cooperation to determine technology standards that requires information sharing to reach consensus and ii) competition for standard implementation to obtain standard-essential patents, which create incentives for firms to deviate from the expected level of information sharing. To minimize detection risk, firms choose to strategically withhold R&D information in 10-K disclosures. Consistent with this hypothesis, we document a significant decrease in the level of 10-K narrative R&D disclosure after a firm joins an SSO. For identification, we consider a quasi-exogenous shock to information sharing introduced by intellectual property litigations and document a significant decrease in SSO firms’ 10-K R&D disclosure. Analyses based on i) SSO firms’ search activities of public filings and ii) proxies for information sharing within the SSO further support our hypothesis.

### "Media Conglomeration, Local News, and Capital Market Consequences" <em>with Travis Dyer and Mark H. Lang</em>
We examine the effect of news media consolidation on local business news dissemination and its consequences for local investors and capital markets. We use acquisitions of television stations by Sinclair Inc. as plausibly exogenous shocks to local news coverage since Sinclair is alleged to reduce local news budgets and homogenize news coverage. Using large-scale television transcripts data, we find that coverage of local firms drops substantially following Sinclair acquisitions. Further, we document that investor attention, trading, portfolio holdings, and stock return synchronicity all become less locally concentrated for firms in treated geographic areas, and that the informational advantage of local analysts decreases and bid-ask spreads increase. In combination, these results provide insight into the consequences of media consolidation for local business coverage, investors, and capital markets.

### "Contract Contingency, Exogenous Uncertainty, and Firm Performance" <em>with Kai Wai Hui, Guoman She, and P. Eric Yeung</em>
We study the contingent clauses specified in firms’ material product market contracts, focusing on exogenous uncertainty as an ex-ante determinant and operating efficiency and betas as ex-post consequences. We develop new measures of contract-level contingencies based on firms’ public disclosures. We document a linear, positive relation between contract contingency and measures of industry- and macro-level uncertainty. We utilize two major uncertainty shocks (2008 Financial Crisis and COVID pandemic) to i) identify causality and ii) detect ex-post benefits of contract contingencies: Contingent contracts allow firms to achieve relatively higher operating efficiency and lower betas when low-likelihood outcomes realize. Consistent with the predictions from dynamic models, we document that the positive contingency-uncertainty relation is less pronounced for relational contracting parties but more pronounced among product market rivals, and that contingencies tend to be roughly written under high uncertainty.

### "Algorithmic Trading and Directors’ Learning from Stock Prices: Evidence from CEO Turnover Decisions" <em>with Jaewoo Kim, Hojun Seo, and Luo Zuo </em>
We examine the effect of algorithmic trading (AT) on directors’ learning from stock prices. We find that the sensitivity of forced CEO turnover to stock returns decreases with AT. We mitigate correlated omitted variable bias by using the 2016 Tick Size Pilot Program as an exogenous shock to AT. In cross-sectional analyses, we document that the negative effect of AT is more pronounced for growth firms, firms with greater exposure to macroeconomic factors, and firms with a geographically dispersed investor base, where the information that AT crowds out is more likely to be new to directors. We also find that the effect is stronger when directors’ expertise likely allows them to extract decision-relevant information from prices and when the directors’ own information set is poor. Overall, our findings suggest that stock prices aggregate information about CEO performance and CEO-firm match, which is otherwise unavailable to directors, and that directors incorporate this information into their CEO turnover decisions.
