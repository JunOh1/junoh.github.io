### "Antitrust Risk and Voluntary M&A Disclosure" <em>(Dissertation)</em>
This study examines whether antitrust risk affects firms’ disclosure of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Due to regulatory exemptions, deals that fall below a size threshold escape formal antitrust scrutiny at the time of the merger. These “non-reported” deals can have important implications for the firm’s pricing power of its products in segmented and localized markets. I hypothesize that firms face a trade-off between the benefits of disclosing these deals to capital markets (i.e., capitalize the product market benefits into stock prices in a timely manner) and the potential antitrust scrutiny the voluntary disclosure can invite, which increases the probability of agencies challenging the merger. Exploiting two quasi-exogenous variations in antitrust enforcement that affect the level of antitrust risk, I find evidence of acquirers strategically managing their disclosure of horizontal and intrastate deals in a way that minimizes antitrust risk. Collectively, my findings shed light on a new determinant of voluntary disclosure: the risk of costly antitrust enforcement.

### "Technology Coopetition and 10-K Voluntary R&D Disclosure" <em>with P. Eric Yeung</em>
We examine firms’ voluntary R&D disclosure under technology coopetition, focusing on technology standard setting organizations (SSOs). Technology coopetition is characterized by i) cooperation to determine technology standards, which requires information sharing to reach consensus, and ii) competition for standard implementation to obtain standard-essential patents, which create incentives for firms to deviate from the expected level of information sharing. To minimize detection risk, firms strategically withhold R&D information in 10-K disclosures. Consistent with this hypothesis, we document a significant decrease in the level of 10-K narrative R&D disclosure after a firm joins an SSO. For identification, we exploit a quasi-exogenous shock to information sharing introduced by intellectual property litigations and document a significant decrease in SSO firms’ 10-K R&D disclosure. Analyses based on i) SSO firms’ search activities of public filings and ii) proxies for information sharing within the SSO further support our hypothesis.

### "Media Conglomeration, Local News, and Capital Market Consequences" <em>with Travis Dyer and Mark H. Lang</em>
We examine the effect of news media consolidation on local business news dissemination and its consequences for local investors and capital markets. We use acquisitions of television stations by Sinclair Inc. as plausibly exogenous shocks to local news coverage since Sinclair is alleged to reduce local news budgets and homogenize news coverage. Using large-scale television transcripts data, we find that coverage of local firms drops substantially following Sinclair acquisitions. Further, we document that investor attention, trading, portfolio holdings, and stock return synchronicity all become less locally concentrated for firms in treated geographic areas, and that the informational advantage of local analysts decreases and bid-ask spreads increase. In combination, these results provide insight into the consequences of media consolidation for local business coverage, investors, and capital markets.

### "Contract Contingencies, Uncertainty, and Firm Performance" <em>with Kai Wai Hui, Guoman She, and P. Eric Yeung</em>
This study examines contingencies written in firms’ material product market contracts, focusing on i) exogenous uncertainty as an ex-ante determinant, and ii) operating efficiency and betas as ex-post consequences. We extract material contracts from firms’ public regulatory filings and document a linear, positive relation between contract contingencies and measures of uncertainty. We utilize two major economic shocks (the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID pandemic) to i) identify causality, and ii) detect ex-post consequences of contract contingencies: Contingent contracts allow firms to achieve relatively higher operating efficiency and lower betas when low-likelihood economic outcomes realize.

### "Algorithmic Trading and Directors’ Learning from Stock Prices: Evidence from CEO Turnover Decisions" <em>with Jaewoo Kim, Hojun Seo, and Luo Zuo </em>
We examine the effect of algorithmic trading (AT) on directors’ learning from stock prices. We find that the sensitivity of forced CEO turnover to stock returns decreases with AT. We mitigate correlated omitted variable bias by using the 2016 Tick Size Pilot Program as an exogenous shock to AT. In cross-sectional analyses, we document that the negative effect of AT is more pronounced for growth firms, firms with greater exposure to macroeconomic factors, and firms with a geographically dispersed investor base, where the information that AT crowds out is more likely to be new to directors. We also find that the effect is stronger when directors’ expertise likely allows them to extract decision-relevant information from prices and when the directors’ own information set is poor. Overall, our findings suggest that stock prices aggregate information about CEO performance and CEO-firm match, which is otherwise unavailable to directors, and that directors incorporate this information into their CEO turnover decisions.
