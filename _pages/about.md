My name is Jun Oh and I am an assistant professor at Purdue University. I hold a Ph.D in Accounting from Cornell University. 

I am broadly interested in the use of firms’ public disclosures, including disclosures in financial statements and voluntary communications, by various stakeholders. 
My research focuses on how firms strategically disclose information, primarily non-earnings and textual information, and the consequences
such disclosures have on stakeholders such as competitors and regulators. My research is largely motivated by industrial organization topics. 
I am also interested in how emerging technologies influence firms' information environment. 

My dissertation examines the intersection between industrial organization and antitrust regulation 
by studying how antitrust risk affects firms’ disclosure of mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
