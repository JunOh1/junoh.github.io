Hello!
------
My name is Jun Oh and I am a fifth-year accounting Ph.D. student at Cornell University, SC Johnson College of Business. 
I am on the 2022-2023 academic job market and expect to graduate in May 2023. 

I am broadly interested in the use of firm’s public disclosures, 
including disclosures in financial statements and in voluntary communications, by various stakeholders.
Specifically, the two strands of my research explore i) 
how firms strategically disclose information, and the consequences such disclosures have on competitors and regulators and ii)
how information frictions influence investors' acquisition of firms' public disclosures. 
My research frequently employs textual analysis and is largely motivated by industrial organization topics. 

In my dissertation, I examine the intersection between industrial organization and antitrust regulation 
by studying how antitrust risk affects firms’ disclosure of mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
