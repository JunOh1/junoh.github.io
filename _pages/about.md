My name is Jun Oh and I am an assistant professor at Purdue University. I hold a Ph.D in Accounting from Cornell University and a CPA license in Korea (KICPA).

My research focuses on the use of firmsâ€™ public disclosures, including disclosures in financial statements and voluntary communications, by various stakeholders. 
I am interested in how firms strategically disclose (non-financial) information and the consequences such disclosures have on stakeholders such as competitors and regulators. 

My research is largely motivated by industrial organization topics, including contracting, product markets, innovation, and M&A.
