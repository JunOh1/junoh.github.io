My name is Jun Oh and I am a fifth-year accounting Ph.D. student at Cornell University, SC Johnson College of Business. 
I am on the 2022-2023 academic job market and expect to graduate in May 2023. 

I am broadly interested in the use of firms’ public disclosures, including disclosures in financial statements and voluntary communications, by various stakeholders. 
My research focuses on how firms strategically disclose information, primarily non-earnings and textual information, and the consequences
such disclosures have on stakeholders such as competitors and regulators. My research is largely motivated by industrial organization topics. 
I am also interested in emerging technologies influence firms' information environment. 

In my dissertation, I examine the intersection between industrial organization and antitrust regulation 
by studying how antitrust risk affects firms’ disclosure of mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
